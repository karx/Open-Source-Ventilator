Box-1.DXF contains the plan for cutting the box of the Open Source respirator.
The material to be used is 12mm baltic birch plywood
The plan can be used either as a template for the different parts or to CNC cut the box.

If you use CNC, the source .cb for the [CAD/CAM software CamBam](http://cambam.info/) is included. Cambam is not free software.

Same goes for DriveShaft.cb that shows the slot cutting in the 8mm (5/16") aluminum rod.
